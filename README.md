<!-- --- About Me --- -->	
I'm currently working as a developer intern on the <a title='Installments' target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.shopify.com/shop-pay-installments">Shop Pay Installments</a> team and pursuing my B.C.S Honours at Carleton University as part of Shopify's <a title='Dev Degree' target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://devdegree.ca/">Dev Degree</a> program. In my spare time, I like to run, code, read, blog, and make music. Sometimes, I dabble in open source and compete in hackathons.
