<!-- --- About Me --- -->	
I'm currently working as a quantitative developer at Citadel.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Applied Machine Learning Engineer at Shopify, where I owned the data and machine learning models driving multi-billion-dollar financial products. I led key projects across growth, payments, fraud, and finance, delivering company-wide impact and was consistently recognized by the CEO and executive team as a top performer.

I completed my Computer Science Honours degree in two years as one of the top 30 students in my class while working full-time, consulting, and acting as a teaching assistant. I have also done machine learning researcher with the Northern Tornadoes Project and consulted for several startups. Outside of work, I enjoy songwriting, performing at open mics, ultra running, and practicing math Olympiad contests.
