<!-- --- About Me --- -->	
I'm an applied machine learning engineer at Shopify on the financial services data team, where I leverage predictive modeling, quantitative analysis, and systems engineering to build several billion-dollar products. In the past, I was one of 15 students part of Shopify's Dev Degree program (http://devdegree.ca/), where I graduated from Carleton University's B.C.S Honours Program in two years as one of the top 30 students in the fall class of 2021.

Previously, I've worked as as a machine learning researcher with the Northern Tornadoes Project, CTO for 5-ing COVID-19, undergraduate teaching assistant, and consultant for several startups. In my spare time, I sing, songwrite, run, and code.
