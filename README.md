<!-- --- About Me --- -->	
I'm a Senior Applied Machine Learning Engineer on the Financial Services team at Shopify where I leverage predictive modelling, quantitative analysis, and systems engineering to power several billion-dollar products for businesses. I completed Shopify's Dev Degree program in two years while receiving a C.S. Honours degree from Carleton University as one of the top 30 students in the graduating year. 

Previously, I've worked as as a machine learning researcher with the Northern Tornadoes Project and consultant for several startups. In my spare time, I play guitar, write songs, run, and code.
