<!-- --- About Me --- -->	
I'm currently working as a data engineer at Shopify part of the <a title='Dev Degree' rel="me" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://devdegree.ca/">Dev Degree program</a> and pursuing an early graduation for my CS Honours degree this August. I work on the side as a teaching assistant, CTO for 5-ing COVID-19, and mentor for peers in STEM. I love neuroscience, computer vision, and all things AI, having previously done deep learning research on the Northern Tornadoes Project. In my spare time, I like singing, ultrarunning, building things, and occasionally - competing in hackathons.
