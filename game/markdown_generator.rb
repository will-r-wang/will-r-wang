        <!-- --- About Me --- -->	
        I'm a data scientist at Shopify on the Capital Algorithms team, where I leverage Machine Learning and Big Data to power financial services data products. In the past, I was part of Shopify's Dev Degree program (http://devdegree.ca/), where I graduated from Carleton University's B.C.S Honours Program in two years as one of the top 30 students in the fall class of 2021.

        Previously, I've worked as as a machine learning researcher with the Northern Tornadoes Project, CTO for 5-ing COVID-19, and undergraduate teaching assistant. Feel free to take a look at my work on Github (@will-r-wang) or schedule a coffee at https://superpeer.com/willrwang - always happy to chat about tech, business, or life!
